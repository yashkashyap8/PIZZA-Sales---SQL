# Pizza Sales Analysis

This project involves the analysis of pizza sales data, uncovering key insights that can drive business decisions and operational improvements. The primary objective is to identify trends, customer preferences, and opportunities for optimizing inventory, reducing waste, and boosting profitability.

## Key Insights & Quantifiable Impact

### 1. Pizza Size Demand & Inventory Optimization
- Over **95% of orders** come from three popular pizza sizes, while **XXL and XS sizes contribute to less than 2%** of sales, indicating low demand.
- **Quantifiable Impact**: By focusing inventory on high-demand sizes, we can reduce storage and ingredient waste by up to **20%**. Additionally, discontinuing or limiting low-demand sizes like XXL and XS could free up **5-10% of storage space**, optimizing operations and boosting profitability.

### 2. Top 5 Pizzas and Menu Optimization
- The top 5 pizzas, out of **32 options**, account for **24% of total sales**, highlighting strong customer preference for a limited selection.
- **Quantifiable Impact**: Focusing marketing and resources on these top-performing pizzas could increase overall revenue by **10-15%**, while reducing production costs tied to the **27 less popular options**.

### 3. Balanced Revenue Contribution by Category
- The four pizza categories—**Classic**, **Veggie**, **Supreme**, and **Chicken**—each contribute **23-27%** to total revenue, indicating a well-balanced menu that appeals equally to different customer preferences.
- **Quantifiable Impact**: Maintaining this balanced menu and marketing effectively across all categories supports revenue stability and minimizes risk associated with over-reliance on any single category.
